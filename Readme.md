## Using Rihana to practice your DSA


Here are the Algorithims Suppported: 
1. LinearSearch
2. BinarySearch,
3. BubbleSort,
4. InsertionSort,
5. SelectionSort,
6. QuickSort,
7. MergeSort,


## How to use this module? 
1. Generate your test files: 
```
    npx run generate
```
this will generate all the files where you can practice your DSA
2. Test your algorithms
```
    npm run test <FILE_NAME that you are editing>
```

3. Want Solution for generated Algorithms:
```
Its somewhere in the source directory search it there
```



# Focus of this projects : 
Focus on these nuts :)

### rihana.config.js has all the necessary algos that are currently testable
